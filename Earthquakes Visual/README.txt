HW4 Visual Choices

-Magnitude color: I chose a darker red and a bright shade of yellow to be the values that I interpolated between. It does a good job at constrasting big differences in magnitude values. 

-Map Size: I chose to scale my map to 1500X756. I thought it was a good enough size to depict the earthquake values where not all of them were too close together but also that the visual elements of the earth weren't too small.

-Circle Size: This was hard, but because of my map size, I chose a circle size for the earthquakes at 7 pixels. I didn't want them to be too big where they overlapped each other too much if close together, but I also didn't want them to be so small that you couldn't see the color within the circle.

Gradient Bar/Legend: I chose to make a gradient bar as my legend to show the wide range of values that the magnitude can have represented as an interpolated value between the two colors. I also made this vertical because I thought it displayed better on with the contents of the window, and I have more information that is already horizontal at the bottom.

Earthquake Information: I decided to add information about the earthquakes at the bottom to give the user a little more information than just visual colors. These include the current year being looked at, the number of earthquakes in that year, and the average magnitude of all the earthquakes in that year.
